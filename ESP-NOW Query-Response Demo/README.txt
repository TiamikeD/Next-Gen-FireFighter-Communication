README:This demo contains 2 folders. One represents the temperature sensor, the other represents the firefighter node that is requesting the data.The Firefighter Node (FFA) sends a request via ESP-NOW to the temp sensor, and the temp sensor then sends back its current temperature. ESP-NOW works by broadcasting a struct, and the sender and receiver must have the same struct definition. There’s also a handshake, verification that data was sent/received, and a count of how many bytes are in a packet.ESP-NOW defines it’s target (receiver) by its MAC address and is able to communicate as soon as its node has power.The next steps (From 3/2/2023) will be figuring out how the state machine works and how to ensure a receiver node is ready to receive data so that packets are not lost.HOW TO SETUP:

The folders should be ready to be opened as projects in PlatformIO. 2 ESPs should be programmed, one with each project. There are LED pins defined, so those can be wired up as well to more visually see the transmission.
